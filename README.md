Experiments in applying latent dirichlet allocation to chord progressions!

I will be notebookifying much more in the coming weeks, as well as creating an interactive topic visualizer that allows you to play a song while watching little charts of how much of each "topic" is playing (kind of like having recipes materialize in your head as you sample different dishes at the buffet).

But first...that requires coherent topics...still working on that!
