# A topic model of chord progressions
Experiments in applying variations of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to chord progressions!

Chords served hot and fresh (after being parser-boiled) from https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/billboard

Chord progressions are created from tokens containing chords, their durations, and their rhythmic positions using a similar collocation finding algorithm to the one used for Word2Vec.

PMI regularized LDA works best.
